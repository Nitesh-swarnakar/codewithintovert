                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the 
                        standard language used to create and design the structure of web pages. It uses a system of tags and elements to define content such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML acts like the skeleton of a website, giving it form, while other technologies like CSS and JavaScript handle styling and interactivity. Think of it as the blueprint that browsers 
                        use to render websites for users.</p>
